                    I studied philosophy at UVSC/UVU (during the transition years). I found myself floundering when it came to the continental tradition,
                    but excelled at formal logic and discrete mathematics. On my instructors' suggestions, I dipped my toes into computer science with
                    a couple classes in C#, but that was as far as I went at the time.

                    I had been driving a cab to make ends meet in college. It was a rough industry, even before Uber put it on life support, but it opened
                    the door for me into hospice care. The past 5 years I've gotten fulfillment from bringing drugs to elderly patients, but fulfillment isn't
                    the same as direction. In that time I've driven 400-thousand miles without ever leaving the state; it strikes me as an apt metaphor.

                    I didn't realize it at the time, but my first programming experience came from creating an RPG in the Warcraft 3 level editor as a teen. I 
                    was preoccupied with seeing myself as "creative," and "subverting" the intended format of the game let me think of it as an art project.
                    Nevertheless I spent about a month creating events and scripts and animations just to put my brother through a single hellish playthrough where
                    he got to see the delightful punishments I'd lined up for him for using cheat codes. In hindsight, if I'd put more thought into it then, I might
                    have come up with programming as a career path sooner, but like I said, I didn't think of what I was doing as programming. I thought programming
                    just meant 1's and 0's.
